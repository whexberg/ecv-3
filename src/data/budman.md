Budman the Benevolent, Noble Grand Humbug of Unparalleled Absurdity

In the annals of Clamperdom, few figures loom as large—or as ludicrous—as Budman the Benevolent, a man of such renown that even the donkeys bray his name in awe. Born under a blood moon (or so he claims), Budman’s rise to the exalted office of Noble Grand Humbug was foretold in a dream by a drunken miner, whose vision of a leader “half sage, half stagecoach wreck” perfectly described Budman’s unique blend of wisdom and whimsicality.

With a keen eye for historical landmarks (and an even keener nose for free libations), Budman is said to possess the uncanny ability to locate both forgotten plaques and untapped kegs. His orations are the stuff of legend, with words so profound that they leave audiences simultaneously enlightened and utterly confused.

Budman’s most celebrated achievement is his invention of the Double Reverse Jackass Salute, a gesture so intricate that even seasoned Clampers have yet to perform it without spraining something. His leadership style, described as “herding cats with a kazoo,” has endeared him to his brethren and ensured that chaos remains an integral part of Clamper tradition.

Whether presiding over meetings, feasting at the Clamper table, or spinning tall tales that grow taller with each retelling, Budman is the embodiment of the Clamper spirit: absurd, affable, and always up for another round. Long may his Humbuggery reign!
