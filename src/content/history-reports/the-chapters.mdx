# THE CHAPTERS OF E CLAMPUS VITUS

### parts one through five*

<br/>
<br/>

* EDITOR'S NOTE: These  are a series of valuable writings that have been presented at LSD #3's general meetings by Kurteous Maximus beginning back in October 1996, so don't go bitching that the info is old.   -  Slick



IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE I WAS TAKEN IN I HAVE TRAVELED TO THE FARTHEST REACHES OF "CLAMPERDOM" AS IT IS OFTEN TIMES CALLED.  IN MY TRAVELS I'VE  MET COUNTLESS REDSHIRTS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND BEING THE CURIOUS FELLOW THAT I AM I ALWAYS ASK THE SAME STUPID QUESTION..."WHAT THE HELL MADE YOU GUYS NAME YOUR CHAPTER THAT? "EACH AND EVERY CHAPTER HAS IT'S OWN STORY TO TELL. SOMETIMES IT'S THE ORIGINAL NAME OF THE TOWN OR CAMP THAT WAS TOO LONG TOO RACY OR JUST TOO HARD TO PRONOUNCE. IN SOME CASES IT'S AN HISTORICAL PERSONAGE THAT THE PROPER, STODGY TYPES WOULD RATHER FORGET. ACCORDINGLY I HAVE COMPILED A SOMEWHAT ABBREVIATED LIST OF THE OFFICIAL, THE UNRECOGNIZED AND THE OUTLAWED.

YOU MUST REALIZE THAT WHEN THIS ALL BEGAN THE GNR WAS JUST A PHONY TITLE AND THE PHRASE "AND SO RECORDED" WAS A JOKE , BECAUSE NO ONE WAS IN ANY CONDITION TO WRITE ANYTHING DOWN AND AFTERWARD THERE WASN'T ANYONE WHO COULD REMEMBER WHAT THE MEETING WAS ABOUT. JUST ABOUT EVERY MINING CAMP HAD A "HALL OF COMPARATIVE OVATIONS" ( WHICH WAS A EUPHEMISM FOR A SALOON) AND A FEW  BROKE BUT THIRSTY MINERS WHO WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO  ASSIST IN THE PROCESS INVOLVED WITH SEEING A FOOL AND HIS MONEY PART COMPANY. THEREFORE MOST OF THE ORIGINAL LODGE NAMES (WHEN THEY HAD ONE) ARE LOST TO HISTORY.



# YERBA BUENA CHAPTER ONE

THE SPANISH FIRST CALLED THE AREA AROUND WHAT WAS TO BECOME THE MISSION SAN FRANCISCO YERBA BUENA MEANING "GOOD GRASS" THIS WAS IN REFERENCE TO GRAZING THEIR HORSES. YOU SEE BACK THEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A HORSE, YOU WEREN'T SHIT. THEREFORE THE CONQUISTADORS  WERE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOME YERBA BUENA.  BECAUSE AS ALWAYS GOOD GRASS IS HARD TO FIND



# DE LA GUERRA Y PACHECO CHAPTER 1.5

THE CHAPTER THAT INHABITS THE COASTAL COUNTIES OF SAN LUIS OBISPO AND SANTA BARBARA IS ALSO THE NEWEST.

STATE  SENATOR PABLO DE LA GUERRA WAS A CLAMPER. WHICH MAY COME AS NO SURPRISE TO SOME FOR AT ONE TIME JUST ABOUT EVERYONE WHO JOINED THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS SOMEWHAT OBLIGATED TO JOIN THE CLAMPERS AS WELL. THAT IS IF HE WANTED TO HAVE ANY LEGISLATION THAT HE AUTHORED TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY HIS FELLOW SOLONS.

IT SEEMS THAT THE HONORABLE SENATOR AUTHORED A SOMEWHAT SELF-SERVING BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE MEMBERS OF THE E CLAMPUS VITUS TO USE THE STATE CAPITOL BUILDING FOR THEIR MEETINGS WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WAS NOT IN SESSION. THIS SOUNDED FINE TO THE SENATE WHERE IT PASSED QUITE HANDILY HOWEVER IT MISSED THE GOVERNORS DESK BY ONE VOTE IN THE ASSEMBLY. RUMOR HAS IT THE ONE VOTE NEEDED WAS THAT OF A DISGRUNTLED POLITICO WHO WAS WASHED OUT OF THE INITIATION OR BLACKBALLED AS THEY USED TO SAY.

NEVER THE LESS PABLO DE LA GUERRA'S BILL THOUGH TABLED,

IS STILL CONSIDERED ACTIVE LEGISLATION A HUNDRED  YEARS LATER

NOW THE OTHER PART OF THIS CHAPTERS BICAMERAL NOMENCLATURE REFERS TO A MILITARY FOOTNOTE IN CALIFORNIO HISTORY IN WHICH A CERTAIN COLONEL PACHECO LED A HEROIC CHARGE AGAINST A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE FROM MEXICO AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE OUTGUNNED AND OUTNUMBERED MANAGED TO GET CUT DOWN LIKE SHEEP.



# PLATRIX CHAPTER TWO

QUEEN OF THE COW COUNTIES

IN THE  SACRED RITUAL OF ECV ONE OF THE SPEAKING PARTS IS THE ROYAL PLATRIX THAT'S THE GUY WHO ACTUALLY BRINGS THE PBC's INTO THE HALL AND LATER ASKS THE ETERNAL QUESTION,"WOULD YOU THEN MOUNT HER, KNOWING FULL WELL SHE DID NOT BELONG TO YOU?

NOW IF WE LOOSELY ANALYZE THE WORD IT MIGHT  BE A CORRUPTION OF THE LATIN WORDS PLAT WHICH MEANS FLAT AND THE WORD MATRIX WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO MEAN WOMB....WELL ANYONE WHO'S EVER BEEN TO LOS ANGELES WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS TO BE AS GOOD A DESCRIPTION OF THEIR TERRITORY AS ANY OTHER



# LORD SHOLTO DOUGLAS CHAPTER THREE

IRREFUTABLY THE MOST CELEBRATED INITIATION THAT EVER TRANSPIRED WAS THAT OF JAMES EDWARD DOUGLAS AN ENGLISH IMPRESARIO OF BUT FOUR AND TWENTY YEARS WHO GOT THE LAST LAUGH WHEN THE OUTFIT HE WAS "TAKEN IN" BY, THE KING SOLOMON LODGE NUMBER No 107, 306 EVENTUALLY FOLDED DUE TO THE HUGE AMOUNT OF PUBLICITY THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED HIS  RATHER THOROUGH INSTALLATION THEREBY CAUSING AN INSURMOUNTABLE SHORTAGE OF SUCKERS.



# QUIVIRA CHAPTER FOUR

I'M NOT ALTOGETHER TO SURE ABOUT THIS ONE BUT I THINK IT WAS EITHER A LOST INDIAN CIVILIZATION NEAR SANTA FE,  OR  A VAST EMPIRE CLAIMED BY THE SPANIARDS BUT IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE GRAND COUNCIL ANYWAY SO FUCK IT



# NEW HELVETIA CHAPTER FIVE

HAVING RECEIVED A LAND GRANT FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THE MAN KNOWN AS JOHANN AGUSTUS SUTTER A SWISS , CALLED HIS SETTLEMENT NEW HELVETIA WHICH TRANSLATES TO NEW SWITZERLAND THE AMERICAN SETTLERS OF THE TIME JUST CALLED IT SUTTER'S FORT.

CHAPTER FIVE'S TERRITORY ENCOMPASSES THE ENTIRE AREA  NOW CALLED SACRAMENTO COUNTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A NARROW STRIP OF LAND IN OLDTOWN. AN EASEMENT IF YOU WILL, THAT THE LSD DRILL TEAM AND PARADE CONTINGENT MARCHES ON EVERY ST. PATRICK'S  DAY



# PRESIDENT WALKER CHAPTER SIX

THERE USED TO BE A CHAPTER IN SAN DIEGO NAMED AFTER  WILLIAM WALKER WHO WITH BACKING BY CORNELIUS VANDERBILT OVERTHREW THE GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA SOME TIME DURING THE 1850s AND MADE HIMSELF PRESIDENT. HIS TERM OF OFFICE TURNED OUT TO BE FOR LIFE BECAUSE AFTER THREE YEARS HE HIMSELF WAS OVERTHROWN AND SUBSEQUENTLY SHOT BY FIRING SQUAD



# CAPTAIN JACK CHAPTER SEVEN

THIS WAS THE ALTURAS LODGE.  CAPTAIN JACK WAS, IN THE WORDS OF MICHAEL BROWN "THE BADDEST MODOC THERE EVER WAS."FOR THREE YEARS CAPITAIN JACK AND HIS BRAVES KEPT THE U.S. ARMY COMPLETELY PARALYZED THROUGH HIT AND RUN ATTACKS THAT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE VOLCANIC CAVES OR "LAVA TUBES" THAT PERMEATE THE MOUNTAINS OF THE REGION. WHEN THEY FINALLY CAME TO THE TRUCE TABLE THE MILITARY MUCK-T-MUCK IN CHARGE HAD CAPTAIN JACK AND ALL OF HIS MINIONS FED POISONED STEW.



# FLOATING WHANG CHAPTER EIGHT

THE INFAMOUS WHANG CHAPTER WAS NAMED AFTER THAT CLAMPOTENT ORIENTAL SAGE AND NAVIGATOR LOW HUNG WHANG SO NATURALLY THEIR TERRITORY WAS THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND ALL THE ISLANDS IN IT. EVENTUALLY THEIRS BECAME A SUPER SECRET SUBSECT THAT REQUIRED P.B.C.s TO HAVE ALREADY ACQUIRED A REDSHIRT ELSEWHERE. WELL APPARENTLY THE GRAND COUNCIL WAS NOT AMUSED AND JERKED THEIR CHARTER A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. I PERSONALLY LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS RECENT TURN OF EVENTS HASN'T SLOWED THEM DOWN ONE BIT



# PLUMAS DEL ORO CHAPTER EIGHT

FROM THE SPANISH "FEATHERS OF GOLD" WHEN THEY FIRST SAW THE DUCK DOWN FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THE SPANISH EXPLORERS KNEW THAT A FINE MEAL COULD BE FOUND UPSTREAM SO THEY CALLED THAT PARTICULAR TRIBUTARY  THE FEATHER RIVER. THIS CHAPTER'S TERRITORY IS ALL OF PLUMAS COUNTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TOWN OF RABBIT CREEK BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY



# BILL MEEK CHAPTER NINE

WILLIAM "BULL" MEEK WAS A MULE SKINNER , TEAMSTER AND WELLS FARGO AGENT BUT HE WAS MOST KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY TO SPIN A YARN AS THEY USED TO SAY. I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT TRUCK DRIVING AND BULLSHITTING  HAVE ALWAYS GONE HAND IN HAND. IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH HE WAS ALSO AN X-HUMBUG, SO THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT AS TO WHY HIS NICKNAME WAS "BULL"

APPARENTLY THIS CHAPTER CHANGED THEIR NAME AND THEIR NUMBER SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE AND THEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE WILLIAM STEWART CHAPTER IN 1962 THEREBY BECOMING



# Wm. "BULL" MEEK -Wm. MORRIS STEWART CHAPTER TEN

THIS IS THE LARGEST CHAPTER IN THE MOTHERLODE CONTROLLING

YUBA, SUTTER AND MOST OF NEVADA COUNTY AS WELL AS A TOWN IN BUTTE CO.

WILLIAM MORRIS STEWART WAS THE FIRST U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA HE WAS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION AND A PRETTY FAIR BULLSHITTER HIMSELF AFTER ALL HE WAS A LAWYER



# JOAQUIN MURRIETA CHAPTER THIRTEEN

ON THE THIRTEENTH OF APRIL 1850 A LAW WAS PASSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO KNOWN AS "THE GREASER ACT" IT TAXED ALL FOREIGN BORN MINERS TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH.  THIS EFFECTIVELY MEANT THE CHINESE AND THE MEXICANS. NOW THIS LAW HAD LITTLE REAL IMPACT ON THE CHINESE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THEY WERE ALREADY PAYING PROTECTION MONEY TO THE TONGS ANYWAY AND SECONDLY THEY HAD A HABIT OF WORKING CLAIMS COLLECTIVELY MEANING THEY WOULD HAVE AS MANY AS THIRTY PEOPLE WORKING ONE CLAIM SO THE FOREIGN MINERS TAX PROVED NO REAL BURDEN TO THEM.

HOWEVER THE MEXICANS AND MOST PARTICULARLY THE CALIFORNIOS WERE NOT AT ALL HAPPY  WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT THEY WERE BORN IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR INABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH MADE IT DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE IT.

SOMETIMES THE TAX TURNED OUT TO BE MORE THAN A PARTICULAR CLAIM WAS WORTH.

NOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF SOMEONE TOOK OVER YOUR HOMELAND AND THEN TAXED YOU SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAD NOT MASTERED THEIR LANGUAGE.

MANY OF THESE MEN TURNED TO A LIFE OF CRIME.

ALMOST OVERNIGHT THERE WERE REPORTS UP AND DOWN THE MOTHERLODE OF RUTHLESS DESPARADOS PERPETRATING MUDEROUS ATTACKS ON WHITES AND CHINESE AFTER A WHILE SOMEONE IN THE MEDIA DETERMINED THAT THESE HEINOUS ACTS MUST BE THE WORK OF A BAND OF CUT THROATS BUT WHO WAS THEIR LEADER?

JUST BEFORE BEING HUNG FOR BANDITRY A MAN NAMED TEODOR VASQEZ IMPLICATED ONE JOAQUIN MURRIETA  SOMEONE HE HAD NEVER MET  . AS HE STOOD ON THE GALLOWS PLAYING FOR TIME HE MANAGED TO COME UP WITH THE NAMES OF MANY OTHERS BUT THIS ONE NAME MANAGED TO STICK IN PEOPLES MINDS MOSTLY BECAUSE HE WAS SAID TO HAVE A SCAR ON HIS FACE.

THE NEWSPAPERS HAVING LITTLE ELSE TO GO BY SEIZED ON THIS AND IT TOOK OFF FROM THERE... ENTER HARRY LOVE. HARRY WAS AN OPPORTUNIST OF THE FIRST ORDER WHO MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO BANKROLL AN OUTFIT LED BY HIM THAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA RANGERS

WE HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON MR. LOVE'S PAST EXCEPT WHAT HE HIMSELF REVEALED IN HIS OWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY THIS WAS QUITE A PIECE OF WORK IN WHICH HE CLAIMED TO BE A WAR HERO AND A TEXAS RANGER.

THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME JOHN BIGLER WAS EAGER TO SEE THE NEWSPAPERS PRINT SOMETHING FAVORABLE ABOUT HIS REGIME AND THE CALIFORNIA RANGERS SEEMED LIKE JUST THE TICKET.

HARRY LOVE WAS GIVEN FREE REIN TO HAND PICK HIS OWN MEN AND QUICKLY SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH RUTHLESS TYPES LIKE THE MAN WHO SHOT JIM SAVAGE WALTER HARVEY. FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THE RANGERS RODE UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN PURSUIT OF THE NOTORIOUS BANDIT JOAQUIN ALTHOUGH THE RANGERS CLAIMED TO BE RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF THEIR CELEBRATED QUARRY WHENEVER THEY NEEDED FUNDING FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE. HARRY KNEW THAT HIS FORTUNE LIE IN KEEPING THE LEGEND OF JOAQUIN ALIVE FOR AS LONG AS HE COULD.

EVENTUALLY ANY VIOLENT CRIME COMMITTED BY AN HISPANIC WAS CREDITED TO JOAQUIN OR ONE OF HIS BAND NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS FROM SAN DIEGO TO YREKA WOULD CREDIT THE BANDIT WITH BEING ABLE TO BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONE TIME. ONE WOULD THINK THAT THIS WOULD TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE SCRATCH THEIR HEADS AND SAY "NO WAY."

BUT IT HAD JUST THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IT TENDED TO LEND A SUPERNATURAL AIR TO THE BANDIT AND HIS MEN.

EVENTUALLY THE STATE GREW WEARY OF DOLING OUT ALL THIS MONEY TO HARRY AND HIS MEN AND DEMANDED RESULTS

WELL RESULTS THEY WANTED AND RESULTS THEY GOT. THE CALIFORNIA RANGERS FINALLY GOT THEIR MAN OR AT LEAST SOMEONE WHO RESEMBLED HIM. THEY LOPPED OFF THE FELLOWS HEAD AND PRESENTED THEIR GRISLY TROPHY ALONG WITH THE HAND OF THREE FINGERED JACK ONE OF HIS KNOWN ACCOMPLICES. WITH NO REASON TO JUSTIFY THE FURTHER EXISTENCE OF THE RANGERS THEY WERE DISBANDED.

STRANGELY ENOUGH THE CRIME RATE AMONG MEXICANS WAS UNAFFECTED BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO NOTICE BECAUSE JOAQUIN WAS DEAD!

EVER THE OPPORTUNIST HARRY LOVE TOOK HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD HE WOULD HAVE MADE P.T. BARNUM PROUD TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THE STATE SHOWING OFF THE HEAD AND HAND CAREFULLY PRESERVED IN A JAR OF ALCOHOL YES THE ENTERTAINMENT STARVED PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PAID GOOD MONEY TO SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT AND HARRY AND HIS ENTOURAGE CONTINUED TO LINE THEIR POCKETS HAWKING THE LEGEND OF JOAQUIN. AFTER A WHILE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE HAD SEEN THE HEAD AND HARRY HAD TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE SOME BEER MONEY SO HE  APPEALED TO AND GOT FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE MONEY TO COVER ALL OF HIS "EXPENSES" THAT HE HAD INCURRED AS THE STATES TIRELESS SERVANT.

SADLY THE HEAD OF JOAQUIN WAS LOST IN THE GREAT SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE.



# JAMES MARSHALL CHAPTER FORTY NINE

JAMES WILSON MARSHALL WAS A DESCENDANT OF JOHN HART A SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.  HE WAS ALSO RELATED TO JOHN MARSHALL THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.  HE HAILED FROM A TOWN CALLED LAMBERTVILLE N.J. WHERE HE IS STILL CONSIDERED THEIR FAVORITE SON. YOUNG WILSON WAS A WHEELWRIGHT.  BACK IN THOSE DAYS A GOOD CARPENTER DREAMED OF SOMEDAY BEING GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE WHEELS. AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF RAMBLING WHICH INCLUDED MISSOURI, OREGON HE EVENTUALLY CAME TO SUTTER'S FORT WHERE HE COULD MAKE OR FIX ANYTHING FROM SPINNING WHEELS TO FURNITURE.

AFTER TAKING A ROLE IN THE BEAR FLAG REBELLION MR. MARSHALL RETURNED TO THE RANCH HE HAD ESTABLISHED WITH THE WAGES HE HAD MADE WORKING FOR CAPTAIN SUTTER ONLY TO FIND IT HAD BEEN PILLAGED IN HIS ABSENCE.  HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO BACK TO WORK FOR THE GOOD CAPTAIN.

AT A PLACE NOT FAR FROM HERE CALLED COLOMA MR. MARSHALL'S JOB WAS TO CONSTRUCT A SAWMILL TO FURNISH BUILDING MATERIALS FOR SUTTERS GROWING EMPIRE. THE SAWMILL WAS TO BE RUN BY HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE AMERICAN RIVER USING A WATER DRIVEN WHEEL. AFTER A RATHER DISMAL TRIAL RUN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MORE WATER WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE TAILRACE TO GET THE WHEEL TO TURN FAST ENOUGH TO BE ABLE  TO MILL ANY LUMBER. THE SOLUTION WAS TO DIG IN THE DAYTIME AND LET THE WATER RUN THROUGH AT NIGHT.  NOW JAMES HAD A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY AND HAD REMARKED IN HIS WRITINGS OF "BLOSSOM" (QUARTZ OUTCROPPINGS) IN THE AREA WELL BEFORE THE ACTUAL GOLD DISCOVERY DATE.  WHEN THE WATER SCOURED OUT THE TAILRACE, NATURALLY THE GOLD WOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE FISSURES IN THE BEDROCK.  THAT MONDAY MARSHALL ORDERED THE HEAD GATE AT THE UPPER END OF THE DITCH SEALED OFF WITH LEAVES, DIRT AND SAW DUST, THUS ALLOWING NO WATER TO COME THROUGH.  WALKING THROUGH THE DITCH HE SPOTTED SOME "COLOR".  NOT WANTING TO BE EMBARRASSED, HE TESTED WHAT HE FOUND BY HITTING IT WITH A ROCK.  IT DID NOT SHATTER, AS FOOLS GOLD WOULD, AND THIS CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS. HE WRAPPED HIS FINDINGS IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND TOOK THEM TO CAPTAIN SUTTER.

THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD NEWS EXCEPT THAT JOHN SUTTER HAD NO CLAIM TO THE LAND THAT THE SAW MILL WAS SITTING ON.  THE FACT IS, THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD PROVED TO BE A DISASTER FOR JOHANN AUGUSTUS SUTTER.  BECAUSE ALL OF HIS WORKERS AT THE FORT LEFT THEIR JOBS FOR THE GOLD FIELDS.  EVEN MARSHALL HIMSELF CAUGHT GOLD FEVER AND GAVE UP ON THE MILL AFTER ONLY TWO YEARS OF OPERATION.

JAMES HAD NUMEROUS OTHER BUSINESS  VENTURES RANGING FROM FARMING AN APPLE ORCHARD TO WINE MAKING TO SELLING HIS AUTOGRAPH FOR .25 A COPY.  ON AUGUST 10, 1885 JAMES WILSON MARSHALL DIED.  A MONUMENT WAS BUILT OVER HIS GRAVE IN COLOMA THAT PORTRAYS MARSHALL WITH A GOLD NUGGET IN ONE HAND AND POINTING TO THE GOLD DISCOVERY SITE WITH THE OTHER.



# TRINITARIANUS CHAPTER SIXTY TWO

THE CHAPTER FROM TRINITY COUNTY IS SOMETIMES PRONOUNCED

TRIH-NIH-TEAR-REE-AAH-NUHS BUT XNGH "REDEYE" WHO WAS TAKEN IN BY CHAPTER SIXTY TWO BACK BEFORE I WAS EVEN ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP SAYS, "AY-NUS".

REGARDLESS OF IT'S PRONUNCIATION NO ONE FROM THERE I'VE TALKED TO KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK IT MEANS



# HUMBUG CHAPTER SEVENTY THREE

THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY DEFINES HUMBUG ALTERNATIVELY AS A HOAX OR A PERSON WHO DELIBERATLY SETS OUT TO DECIEVE OTHERS, A CHARLATAN.  I AM SURE EVERYONE HERE IS WELL AWARE OF A THIRD DEFINITION OF THE WORD HUMBUG, THAT  OF COURSE BEING AN X-HUMBUG IN IT'S LARVAL STAGE

THERE IS A CREEK IN SISKIYOU COUNTY CALLED THE HUMBUG, WHICH FLOWS THROUGH THEIR TERRITORY AND INTO THE MIGHTY KLAMATH. I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEIR ONCE WAS A TOWN OF THE SAME NAME BUT IT'S NOT ON THE MAP NOW. IF ANYONE HAS ANYMORE INFORMATION ON THE HUMBUG CHAPTER I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.



# GROWLERSBURG CHAPTER EIGHTY SIX

GROWLERSBURG WAS THE ORIGINAL NAME OF GEORGETOWN WHICH ALONG WITH UNCLE TOM'S CABIN MAKES UP THE GROWLERSBURG ENVIRONS



#AL PACKER  ONE HUNDRED

THIS IS AN OUTPOST OF THE MATT WARNER CHAPTER AND CLAIMS THE ENTIRE STATE OF COLORADO AS THEIR TERRITORY.

AFTER THE WORST SNOWSTORM IN MANY MANY YEARS AL PACKER AND SOME OTHERS FOUND THEMSELVES SNOWED IN FOR THE WINTER.THIS WAS  NOT FAR FROM WHAT WAS AT THAT TIME THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE UNITED STATES AT AROUND 14,000 FEET.  AFTER A FEW MONTHS, STARVATION DROVE THESE MEN TO DESPERATION AND THE LIVING BEGAN TO FEED OFF THE BODIES OF THE DEAD. ONCE A MAN HAS CROSSED THAT LINE AND HE BECOMES A CANNIBAL , MURDER BECOMES JUST ANOTHER CRIME. OBVIOUSLY

IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE SURVIVORS BEGAN TO CONTEMPLATE EACH OTHER. AL PACKER AND HIS PARTNER DID AWAY WITH THE OTHERS AND FED OFF THEIR BODIES

EVENTUALLY MR. PACKER KILLED HIS PARTNER BECAUSE HE WAS SURE THAT HE WAS PLOTTING HIS DEMISE. WHEN THE THAW FINALLY CAME, AL PACKER WAS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE

AL PACKER IS THE ONLY MAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES TO BE TRIED AND HUNG FOR THE CRIME OF MURDER FOR THE PUPOSE OF CANNIBALISM



# EUREKA CHAPTER 101

EUREKA IS A GREEK WORD MEANING "I HAVE FOUND IT" WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE MOTTO. WHICH USUALLY IS IN REFERENCE TO GOLD

THIS PARTICULAR CHAPTER IS BASED IN EUREKA AND THEIR TERRITORY ENCOMPASSES HUMBOLDT COUNTY.  THEY'VE TAKEN THE NUMBER DESIGNATION 101 FROM THE HIWAY THAT PASSES THROUGH TOWN
