# PLURALITY





AS THE PRESEDENTIAL PRIMARIES HEAT UP IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO THINK BACK TO LESSONS THAT PREVIOUS ELECTIONS HAVE TAUGHT US SPECIFICALLY IN THE MATTER OF PLURALITY.

WHEN EVER SOMEONE WINS AN ELECTIN WITH LESS THAN 50% OF THE VOTE THIS IS KNOWN AS WINNING BY A PLURALITY.

THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE WHEN A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION GETS FED UP WITH THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM
