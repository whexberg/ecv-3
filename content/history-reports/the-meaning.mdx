`BORN AGAIN BOB`

THIS IS DEDICATED TO YOUR LASTING MEMORY

<br />
<br />



THE MEANING OF THE WORDS E CLAMPUS VITUS IS SOMEWHAT OBSCURE

THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXPLANATION ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN “E CLAMPUS VITUS THEN AND NOW”

BY THE WAY I SHORTENED THIS UP JUST BIT SO THAT THE OLDER  AND LESS SOBER  MEMBERS DON’T LAPSE INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND BEGIN TO SNORE …OKAY LEAK?



THE MEANING


IT IS AGREED BY SOME THEOLOGIANS THAT THE LETTER  “E” STANDS FOR ELOHIST PROPHETIC DOCUMENT

ONE OF THE ANCIENT CHRONICLES FROM WHOSE WISDOM THE PAST NOBLE GRAND HUMBUG, MOSES DRANK COPIOUSLY JUST BEFORE HE DICTATED THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.

THUS STANDS CONFIRMED THE TRADITION THAT THE ORDER WAS FOUNDED IN THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND IS COEVAL WITH THE HUMAN RACE

IN THE WORD “CLAMPUS” MAY BE  RECEOGNIZED THE WORD “KLEPT”  TO TAKE OR STEAL TO CARRY OFF

THIS CLEARLY SIGNIFIES THAT ADAM STOLE OR SMUGGLED OUT OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN HIDDEN BENEATH HIS APRON THE SEEDS AND SYMBOLS OF THE ORDER.

THE ONLY RELICS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESERVED OF THE ORIGINAL HAPPY AND VIRTUOUS STATE OF MANKIND

THE WORD “VITUS”, FROM THE GREEK “PHITOS” A FATHER REFERING TO ADAM THE ORIGINAL FATHER AND PROGENITOR OF US ALL

SECONDLY CONCERNING THE NOBILITY, VERITABILITY, AND ESSENTIAL VIRILITY OF E CLAMPUS VITUS, SOME HISTORIANS SAY IT IS KNOWN THAT THE LETTER  “E “ DESCENDS FROM PHONECIAN CHARTER (HE) A WINDOW, SIGNIFYING THAT THROUGH THE ADMISSION TO THE ORDER, AS THROUGH A WINDOW, A LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE COMES TO THE POOR BLIND CANDIDATE WHO HAVE LONG GROPED IN DARKNESS. THIS IS MORE EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT “E” IS NOT ONLY A LETTER BUT IT IS ALSO A WORD,

IN LATIN MEANING “OUT OF.”  CLAMPUS ON THE OTHER HAND IS CLEALY REMENISCENT OF THE LATIN WORD CLAM WHICH SIGNIFIES UNKNOWN TO, WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF, IN OTHER WORDS IN IGNORANCE OR DARKNESS. THUS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT E CLAM PLAINLY MEANS OUT OF DARKNESS

THE TERM “PUS” IS TAKEN FROM THE LATIN POS MEANING AFTER AND VITUS FROM  “VITA” LIFE WHICH COMPLETES THE MEANING OUT OF DARKNESS AFTER SEEKING LIFE SIGNIFYING THAT ALL GOOD CLAMPERS SEEK LIFE AMONG THE BRIGHT LIGHTS

THE TRUE TITLE OF THIS CONFRATERNITY THUS IS, AS ORIGINALLY POSTULATED, E C V

AND IT EMBODIES IN SYMBOLIC FORM THE IMMEMORIAL ANTIQUITY, THE EXALTED NOBILITY

AND THE COGENT REGENERATIVE PROLIFIC POTENCY WHICH HAVE CHARACTERIZED THE ORDER FROM IT’S FIRST BEGINNING AND WILL EVER ASSURE ITS PREEMINENCE.

SO AS YOU CAN PLAINLY SEE

THE MEANING OF THIS TITLE STILL REMAINS A MYSTERY TO HISTORIANS
