# QUEHO



QUEHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS OUTLAWS THAT EVER INHABITED THE STATE OF NEVADA

HE WAS BORN TOA WOMAN OF THE COCOPAH TRIBEAROUIND 1880.

HIS FATHERS IDENTITY IS A MYSTERY.

QUEHO WAS AN OUTCAST AMONG THE NATIVE AMERICANS PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS BORN WITH A CLUBFOOT AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIS QUESTIONABLE PARENTAGE

HE GREW UP IN LAS VEGAS ON THE INDIAN RESERVATION

ALTHOUGH THE STORY ON HOW HE BEGAN HIS LIFE OF LAWLESSNESS DIFFER WITH EACH STORY TELLER,

IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT HE PROBABLY KILLED ANOTHER INDIAN NAMED HARRY BISMARK DURING A DRUNKEN FIGHT. IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT HE KILLED TWO OTHER MEN WHILE MAKING HIS ESCAPE.

HE DID HOWEVER ASSAULT A SHOP OWNER NAMED HY BOHN WHILE STOCKING UP FOR HIS GETAWAY

HE FLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO THE GOLDBUG MINE WHERE HE KILLED SPECIAL DEPUTY “DOC” GILBERT. DOC HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE BACK AND HIS SPECIAL DEPUTY BADGE No. 896 HAD BEEN STOLEN.

FROM THAT DAY FORWARD ANY UNSOLVED CRIME WAS ATTRIBUTED TO QUEHO. OFTEN TRACKS THAT COULD ONLY BELONG TO A MAN WITH A CLUBFOOT WERE FOUND AT  CRIME SCENESWHERE SOMEONE HAD BEEN  MURDERED FOR SUPPLIES.

THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE OF CRIME THE LAW WAS ALWAYS ONE STEP BEHIND HIM.

IT IS SAID THAT TWENTY-THREE PEOPLE WERE MURDERED BY QUEHO BETWEEN 1897 AND 1919 AND THE REWARDS FOR HIS CAPTURE TOTALED MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

THIS WAS BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN TWO DOLLARS A DAY WAS WORKMAN’S WAGES.

HUNDREDS SEARCHED FOR QUEHO BUT NO ONE EVER FOUND HIM.

PARENTS USED TO SCARE THEIR CHILDREN BY TELLING THEM THAT QUEHO WOULD GET THEM IF THEY DIDN’T WATCH OUT

IN FEBRUARY OF 1940 TWO PROSPECTORS FOUND QUEHO’S MUMMIFIED REMAINS IN A CAVE IN BLACK CANYON NEVADA INCLUDED WITH THE BODY WERE ARTICLES OF CLOTHING COOKING UTENSILS AND A SPECIAL DEPUTY BADGE No.896
