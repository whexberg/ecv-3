In 1868 the Kaiser brothers, Samuel and Frank, sold the business to Frank Lux, who in turn sold the brewery to Fred Grohs in 1874.

The purchasers are both first class men, and are both old and experienced brewers, the former, Mr. Krauss, having served for some years as head brewer of this same establishment. They paid $10,500.

A year later Krauss sold his share to Jacob Roll for $6500 June 8, 1881.
