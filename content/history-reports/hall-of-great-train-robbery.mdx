The Great Train Robbery was a famous and sensational crime that occurred in Roseville, California, on December 30, 1923. This incident involved the robbery of a Southern Pacific freight train in which over $225,000 (equivalent to approximately $3.5 million in today's currency) was stolen. The robbers carefully planned the crime, using stolen identification to pose as Southern Pacific Railroad employees and gaining access to the train while it was stopped in the railyard.

The robbers used a system of signals to communicate with each other, and as the train was departing, they climbed aboard, overpowered the crew, and forced the engineer to stop the train at a prearranged location. They then uncoupled the locomotive and three baggage cars, which contained the cash, and made their getaway. They fled to San Francisco, where they eventually split up.

One of the robbers, Eugene Victor Debs, was arrested in 1924 and sentenced to 30 years in prison, but he managed to escape from Folsom Prison in 1928. He was recaptured in 1935 and sent to Alcatraz, where he served out his sentence.

The other robber, John F. Johnson, was never apprehended and remained a fugitive for the rest of his life, dying in 1966 without ever being caught.

The Great Train Robbery was one of the largest and most audacious crimes of its time, and it remains a legendary event in California history.

WHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?
