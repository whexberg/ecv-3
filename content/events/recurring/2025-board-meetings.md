The Board Meeting is where the Chapter’s officers gather to handle official business, review upcoming plans, and ensure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. These meetings focus on decision-making, budgeting, event coordination, and any matters requiring leadership attention.

While typically limited to Board members and invited guests, all decisions made support the well-being of the Chapter, our charitable efforts, and the traditions of E Clampus Vitus. Topics commonly include:

- Financial Reports & Budgeting
- Event Planning & Logistics
- Charitable and Widder/Orphan Support Oversight
- Membership & Administrative Matters
- Long-Term Chapter Planning

Board Meetings keep the Chapter organized, accountable, and ready for the work ahead. Through careful planning and stewardship, the Board ensures that every event, donation, and gathering reflects the values and history we proudly uphold.
