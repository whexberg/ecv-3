Our General Meetings are held regularly to bring Redshirts together in the spirit of fellowship, history, and good works. These gatherings give us a chance to share upcoming events, discuss charitable efforts, plan Clampouts, and make sure every Brother stays connected with the Chapter’s doings.

All members in good standing are welcome. Whether you’re a long-time Brother or newly inducted, the General Meeting is the place to stay involved, lend a hand, and help guide the Chapter’s future. Meetings typically cover:

- Upcoming Events & Work Parties
- Charity and Widder/Orphan Support Updates
- Chapter Business & Voting Matters
- Historical Presentations or Local Lore
- Social Time With Fellow Redshirts

Come out, share your voice, and be part of the ongoing story of our Chapter. We meet to honor our history, support our community, and keep the spirit of E Clampus Vitus alive.
