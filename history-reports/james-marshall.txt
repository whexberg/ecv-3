f:T4cc,AT A PLACE NOT FAR FROM HERE CALLED COLOMA MR. MARSHALL'S JOB WAS TO CONSTRUCT A SAWMILL TO FURNISH BUILDING MATERIALS FOR SUTTERS GROWING EMPIRE. THE SAWMILL WAS TO BE RUN BY HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE AMERICAN RIVER USING A WATER DRIVEN WHEEL. AFTER A RATHER DISMAL TRIAL RUN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MORE WATER WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE TAILRACE TO GET THE WHEEL TO TURN FAST ENOUGH TO BE ABLE  TO MILL ANY LUMBER. THE SOLUTION WAS TO DIG IN THE DAYTIME AND LET THE WATER RUN THROUGH AT NIGHT.    WHEN THE WATER SCOURED OUT THE TAILRACE, NATURALLY  GOLD WOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE FISSURES IN THE BEDROCK.  THAT MONDAY MARSHALL ORDERED THE HEAD GATE AT THE UPPER END OF THE DITCH SEALED OFF WITH LEAVES, DIRT AND SAW DUST, THUS ALLOWING NO WATER TO COME THROUGH.  NOW JAMES HAD A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY AND HAD REMARKED IN HIS WRITINGS OF "BLOSSOM" (QUARTZ OUTCROPPINGS) IN THE AREA WELL BEFORE THE ACTUAL GOLD DISCOVERY DATE. WALKING THROUGH THE DITCH HE SPOTTED SOME "COLOR".  NOT WANTING TO BE EMBARRASSED, HE TESTED WHAT HE FOUND BY HITTING IT WITH A ROCK.  IT DID NOT SHATTER, AS FOOLS GOLD WOULD, AND THIS CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS. HE WRAPPED HIS FINDINGS IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND TOOK THEM TO CAPTAIN SUTTER.7:["$","article",null,{"className":"md:px-8 mx-auto max-w-5xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col items-center gap-4 text-center leading-relaxed my-8","style":{"fontFamily":"'Cinzel', 'Cinzel Fallback'","fontStyle":"normal"},"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-5xl tracking-[0.5rem] my-8 text-red-700 font-bold","children":"James Marshall"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl tracking-[0.75rem] text-red-700 font-bold","children":"HISTORIANS REPORT"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"AS PREPARED BY"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-xl tracking-widest text-red-700 font-bold","children":"\"KURTeous MAXIMVS\""}],["$","p",null,{"className":"tracking-normal","children":"FOR THE GENERAL MEETING OF"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"tracking-normal","children":"THE ANCIENT AND HONORABLE ORDER OF"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-3xl tracking-[1rem] font-bold text-red-700","children":"E CLAMPUS VITUS"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-xl","children":"LORD SHOLTO DOUGLAS CHAPTER No. 3"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-center text-red-700","children":"February 19, 1998 C.Y. 6003"}]]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"text-center","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"m-2 __className_359ec7","children":"LAST MONTH MARKED THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF THE GOLD DISCOVERY AT COLOMA WHICH MADE THE SUBJECT OF THIS MONTH'S HISTORY REPORT SOMEWHAT OBLIGATORY"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"m-2 __className_359ec7","children":"THIS WAS ORIGINALLY READ IN SEPTEMBER OF 1996"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"m-2 __className_359ec7","children":"I HAVE ADDED SOME MATERIAL THAT I THINK WILL GIVE A LITTLE MORE INSIGHT INTO THE SUBJECT OF THIS MONTH'S DISSERTATION"}],"\n",["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl py-4 mt-8 __className_359ec7","id":"james-marshall","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"#james-marshall","children":"JAMES MARSHALL"}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"m-2 __className_359ec7","children":"JAMES WILSON MARSHALL WAS A DESCENDANT OF JOHN HART A SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"className":"m-2 __className_359ec7","children":"Editor's Note - Sometime we learn of occasional \"inaccuracies\" in a report.
