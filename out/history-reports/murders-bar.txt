They decided to stay and mine so several of them left to buy supplies in Coloma. One story says that Indians had been camped nearby and undue liberties with their women had been taken, but whatever the reason, when the men who left camp returned, they found their companions dead while the gold they had mined was still there.

Bruckner took his knife and carved the name ‘Murderer’s Bar’ into an alder tree and the three crossed the stream to another more defensible sand bar and set up camp.

After much hard work the structure was finished on a Saturday in early September. The men decided to wait until Monday to begin gold recovery, but Sunday morning two men who could not wait slipped into the stream bed and found nine and a half pounds of gold before breakfast.
