                body: 'Shortly after the June fire of 1855, a brewery was erected by Samuel Kaiser. The capacity of the establishment is sufficient for the manufacture of four hundred gallons of ale and beer per day. A market for which is found through all the borders of Placer.\n\nIn 1868 the Kaiser brothers, Samuel and Frank, sold the business to Frank Lux, who in turn sold the brewery to Fred Grohs in 1874.\n\nJune 5, 1880, the old Auburn Brewery, long noted for the superior excellence of its product, has changed, F. Grohs, for a long time popular proprietor, having sold out to Mr. John Krauss and Mr. Jacob Roll.\n\nThe purchasers are both first class men, and are both old and experienced brewers, the former, Mr. Krauss, having served for some years as head brewer of this same establishment. They paid $10,500.\n\nA year later Krauss sold his share to Jacob Roll for $6500 June 8, 1881. Due to earlier, Krauss and Roll has a physical altercation and Krauss sustained various injuries including a broken collar bone. The verdict reached at November 7, 1881, trial for the incident that had occurred on May 31, 1881, was that Jacob Roll would pay John Krauss $500 damages in addition to costs.\n\nApril 22, 1882, Julius Weber, who later would be murdered by his son, paid $7,000 to become a partner with Jacob Roll. Soon after Weber would by out Roll\'s share.\n\nJanuary 2, 1896, Ferdinand Rechenmacher acquired the brewery from Julius Weber. Ferdinand Rechenmacher, won two World Prizes from his steam beer ..."\n\nHe advertised that Placer barley, Russian River hops, and spring water at the site made the beer special. In about 1908, when lager beer began to be produced, Rechenmacher felt it would be too expensive to compete and sold the brewery and went to produce beer in Truckee. He died in 1910.\n\nCurrently there are ten breweries and tap houses within Auburn, including Moonraker Brewing, Crooked Lane Brewing, Knee Deep Brewing, Auburn Alehouse, Rebellion Brewing, Moonraker Millhouse, Hillenbrand Farmhaus Brewery, Grass Valley Brewing Company, The Annex Tap Room & Provisions, and Two Ass Brewing.\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?',

Jonathan Davis, a veteran of the Mexican American War. The year was 1854 and the very early days of the Gold Rush where a man could leave a shovel on the ground as a claim or leave his rocker unguarded were long gone.\n\nOn December 19, 1854, Captain Jonathan Rutledge Davis, Dr. Bolivar Sparks and James McDonald were out prospecting for gold on an isolated trail in Rocky Canyon, today known as Ruck-a-Chucky Road. They were suddenly ambushed by a group of fourteen armed bandits. James McDonald fell dead before he could even draw his pistol. Dr. Sparks was a bit quicker on the draw and fired off two shots before he was severely wounded. The formidable Capt. Davis, however, instantly drew his two Colt revolvers and began a barrage of fire at the bandits. Within seconds, with deadly aim, seven of the bandits lay dead or seriously wounded.\n\nWith both parties out of ammunition, three of the surviving bandits pulled out Bowie knives and the forth brandished a short sword. They all lunged at Davis only to find he had his own Bowie knife. He stabbed one of the bandits to death, he disarmed another by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose. Two more bandits advanced on the Captain only to be mortally stabbed. Three remaining outlaws fled the scene\n\nCapt. Davis quickly tore his shirt into strips and began to bandage Dr. Spark’s wounds and even the wounds of the injured bandits. John Webster, Isaac Hart and P. S. Robertson from a group of fellow miners who had observed the whole shoot- out from a nearby hill helped tend to the wounded.  later that night three of the bandits died. Before he died, the leader of the group, the bandit who lost his nose in the fight confessed to the gang’s murder of Six Chinese and four Americans in the days right before they encountered Davis and his party. The next morning another of the bandits died and Capt. Davis and the miners buried all eleven of them in Rocky Canyon.  Davis himself had several flesh wounds and at least six bullets had passed through his hat and eleven more through his shirt and coat. The miners stripped the bandits of their ill- gotten loot, some $491 in gold and silver coin, two silver watches, seven gold watches and four ounces of gold dust. The miners all decided the plunder should go to Dr. Spark’s family after he passed on December 26th in his home in Coloma.\n\nThe Mountain Democrat published an extra edition to recount the tale. The story was quickly picked up by nearby newspapers and soon by newspapers all over the country. At first the story seemed so incredulous that many of the newspaper accounts thought it to be an exaggerated report. A brother – in- law of Dr. Sparks took it upon himself to find the three miners who witnessed the event. Along with eye-witnesses that recounted the events of the affair.\n\nAs the facts of the matter were set to rest, Jonathan Davis said, “I only did what hundreds of others might have done under similar circumstances and attach no particular credit to myself for it’.\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?',

Unable to resolve their differences they agreed to a duel.\n\nThe two men walked 2 to 3 miles out of town onto Fruitvale Road. Such a walk was customary to give both men time to reflect and perhaps rethink the duel, but neither man changed his mind.\n\nUnlike duels of the past there were no seconds, no witnesses and when the shooting started each man fired several bullets. Both men took cover behind trees but their final shots were on target. Morales was shot in the chest while Martinez was fatally struck in the head.\n\nMorales was taken to the Placer County hospital where Dr. Mackay reported he would likely survive. He was arrested for murder, but District Attorney Orin J. Lowell discovered he would have to try Morales under an old dueling statute, which carried a sentence of one to seven years.\n\nMorales recovered from his wound and in September was tried for murder as the result of the duel.\n\nOn September 25, 1925, he was found guilty. According to the Auburn Journal it was the first murder conviction for a duelist in California since 1859. He was sentenced by Judge Landis to serve one to seven years in San Quentin Prison. He was discharged from Prison November 22, 1928.\n\nThe dueling statute was finally repealed by passage of a bill by the California State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Pete Wilson on July 20,1994.\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?',

                body: "The Great Train Robbery was a famous and sensational crime that occurred in Roseville, California, on December 30, 1923. This incident involved the robbery of a Southern Pacific freight train in which over $225,000 (equivalent to approximately $3.5 million in today's currency) was stolen. The robbers carefully planned the crime, using stolen identification to pose as Southern Pacific Railroad employees and gaining access to the train while it was stopped in the railyard.\n\nThe robbers used a system of signals to communicate with each other, and as the train was departing, they climbed aboard, overpowered the crew, and forced the engineer to stop the train at a prearranged location. They then uncoupled the locomotive and three baggage cars, which contained the cash, and made their getaway. They fled to San Francisco, where they eventually split up.\n\nOne of the robbers, Eugene Victor Debs, was arrested in 1924 and sentenced to 30 years in prison, but he managed to escape from Folsom Prison in 1928. He was recaptured in 1935 and sent to Alcatraz, where he served out his sentence.\n\nThe other robber, John F. Johnson, was never apprehended and remained a fugitive for the rest of his life, dying in 1966 without ever being caught.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery was one of the largest and most audacious crimes of its time, and it remains a legendary event in California history.\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?",

Our appreciation goes out to our readership for keeping us "on our toes" - Slick\n\nApparently...James Wilson Marshall was NOT a descendant of John Hart, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.  He was a very distant cousin, a descendant in the John[3] Hart line, whereas Signer John was descended from the Edward[3] Hart line.  Indeed: Signer John was Edward\'s son; James W. was a great-great-great-great-grandson of John[3].  James Wilson Marshall did NOT have any relationship to Justice James Marshall; they were of completely different families.\n\nHE WAS ALSO RELATED TO JOHN MARSHALL THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.  HE HAILED FROM A TOWN CALLED LAMBERTVILLE N.J. WHERE HE IS STILL CONSIDERED THEIR FAVORITE SON. YOUNG WILSON WAS A WHEELWRIGHT.  BACK IN THOSE DAYS A GOOD CARPENTER DREAMED OF SOMEDAY BEING SKILLED ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE WHEELS. AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF RAMBLING WHICH INCLUDED MISSOURI AND OREGON HE EVENTUALLY CAME TO SUTTER\'S FORT WHERE THEY FOUND HE COULD MAKE OR FIX ANYTHING FROM SPINNING WHEELS TO FURNITURE.\n\nAFTER TAKING A ROLE IN THE BEAR FLAG REBELLION MR. MARSHALL RETURNED TO THE RANCH HE HAD ESTABLISHED WITH THE WAGES HE HAD MADE WORKING FOR CAPTAIN SUTTER ONLY TO FIND IT HAD BEEN PILLAGED IN HIS ABSENCE.  HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO BACK TO WORK FOR THE GOOD CAPTAIN.\n\nAT A PLACE NOT FAR FROM HERE CALLED COLOMA MR. MARSHALL\'S JOB WAS TO CONSTRUCT A SAWMILL TO FURNISH BUILDING MATERIALS FOR SUTTERS GROWING EMPIRE. THE SAWMILL WAS TO BE RUN BY HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE AMERICAN RIVER USING A WATER DRIVEN WHEEL. AFTER A RATHER DISMAL TRIAL RUN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MORE WATER WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE TAILRACE TO GET THE WHEEL TO TURN FAST ENOUGH TO BE ABLE  TO MILL ANY LUMBER. THE SOLUTION WAS TO DIG IN THE DAYTIME AND LET THE WATER RUN THROUGH AT NIGHT.    WHEN THE WATER SCOURED OUT THE TAILRACE, NATURALLY  GOLD WOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE FISSURES IN THE BEDROCK.  THAT MONDAY MARSHALL ORDERED THE HEAD GATE AT THE UPPER END OF THE DITCH SEALED OFF WITH LEAVES, DIRT AND SAW DUST, THUS ALLOWING NO WATER TO COME THROUGH.  NOW JAMES HAD A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY AND HAD REMARKED IN HIS WRITINGS OF "BLOSSOM" (QUARTZ OUTCROPPINGS) IN THE AREA WELL BEFORE THE ACTUAL GOLD DISCOVERY DATE. WALKING THROUGH THE DITCH HE SPOTTED SOME "COLOR".  NOT WANTING TO BE EMBARRASSED, HE TESTED WHAT HE FOUND BY HITTING IT WITH A ROCK.  IT DID NOT SHATTER, AS FOOLS GOLD WOULD, AND THIS CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS. HE WRAPPED HIS FINDINGS IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND TOOK THEM TO CAPTAIN SUTTER.\n\nTHIS WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD NEWS EXCEPT THAT JOHN SUTTER HAD NO CLAIM TO THE LAND THAT THE SAW MILL WAS SITTING ON.  THE FACT IS, THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD PROVED TO BE A DISASTER FOR JOHANN AUGUSTUS SUTTER.  BECAUSE ALL OF HIS WORKERS AT THE FORT LEFT THEIR JOBS FOR THE GOLD FIELDS.  EVEN MARSHALL HIMSELF CAUGHT GOLD FEVER AND GAVE UP ON THE MILL AFTER ONLY TWO YEARS OF OPERATION.\n\n\n\nJAMES WAS NOT AS LUCKY AS MOST PEOPLE THINK AND DID NOT BECOME RICH, JUST FAMOUS. ANYTIME  HIS IDENTITY WAS REVEALED SOMEONE WOULD ALWAYS BE ASKING HIS ADVICE OR FOLLOWING HIM AROUND LIKE HE WAS SOME SORT OF LATTER DAY KING MIDAS.  JAMES HAD NUMEROUS OTHER BUSINESS  VENTURES RANGING FROM FARMING AN APPLE ORCHARD TO WINE MAKING TO SELLING HIS AUTOGRAPH FOR .25 A COPY. JAMES  APPLIED FOR AND GOT A STIPEND FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.  EVENTUALLY MR. MARSHALL LOST THIS GRANT WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD ALLOWED ALCOHOL TO BECOME HIS MASTER.\n\nON AUGUST 10, 1885 JAMES WILSON MARSHALL DIED PENNILESS.\n\nIN TIME A MONUMENT WAS BUILT OVER HIS GRAVE IN COLOMA THAT PORTRAYS MARSHALL WITH A GOLD NUGGET IN ONE HAND AND POINTING TO THE GOLD DISCOVERY SITE WITH THE OTHER.\n\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHREN!\n\nFYIK',

                body: 'It is still known as Murderer’s Bar, just as it was in 1849 when, in late April, six or seven miners from Oregon prospected up the Middle Fork of the American River until they found a rich strike just below a waterfall. They decided to stay and mine so several of them left to buy supplies in Coloma. One story says that Indians had been camped nearby and undue liberties with their women had been taken, but whatever the reason, when the men who left camp returned, they found their companions dead while the gold they had mined was still there. The men rushed back to Coloma and accused the local Indians, many working for John Sutter and James Marshall, of the foul deed. A large number of innocent natives were eventually killed in the El Dorado Indian War that followed.\n\nAt about this time Captain Ezekiel Merritt, Thomas Bruckner and an Indian boy named Peg also were working their way upstream on the middle fork when they came on a plundered camp and an ash heap that held still unburned human bones. The next day, just past a rocky point along the river below the waterfall, sixty or so well armed Indians appeared but there was no fight and after several hours the Indians filtered back into the forest. Bruckner took his knife and carved the name ‘Murderer’s Bar’ into an alder tree and the three crossed the stream to another more defensible sand bar and set up camp. Here they found more gold and determined to stay. The Indians never returned and by June the area teemed with miners.\n\nSummer 1850 saw 1500 men working below the falls and finding from half an ounce to several pounds of gold a day, but the bed of the river was known to yield several ounces of gold to the pan. The miners of Sailor’s Claim, Murderer’s, Bruckner’s, New York and Vermont Bars all joined together to build a giant flume to carry the river’s water and leave its bottom free for mining. After much hard work the structure was finished on a Saturday in early September. The men decided to wait until Monday to begin gold recovery, but Sunday morning two men who could not wait slipped into the stream bed and found nine and a half pounds of gold before breakfast. At $35.10 per ounce totaling $5335,20 equaling $201,881.84 in 2024.\n\nBlack clouds rolled in later that day and high in the Sierra torrents of rain fell. By Monday water cascaded down the river, swamped the flume and rushed over the dam until the whole structure gave way, with the flume washing several miles downstream before breaking apart.\n\nThe flood of 1850 was long remembered in the mines.\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?',

                body: 'Old Joe "Everybody liked that horse"\n\nThe stage coach era lasted much long than one might imagine given the rough and steep terrain in our county. In 1901 John McAnich of Auburn was still running the Auburn, Colfax and Forest Hill Stage Line. On July 3rd, driver Henry Crockett was heading to Forest Hill with passengers, a Wells Fargo box and a load of ice cream for the July 4th celebration the next day. Henry’s team was led by “Old Joe” his favorite horse. The stage route was a difficult one and it was said that no one knew the route better than Old Joe. Passengers felt safe with him at the lead.\n\nAbout seven miles from Forest Hill, after a step 10-mile climb, a lone robber stopped the stage. He wore a mask and had sacks on his feet and carried a double-barreled shotgun. The bandit ordered Crockett to throw out the Wells Fargo express box. Crockett is reported to have replied “Ah, go on, you’re joshing.” Some reports say he said “you must be foolin”. Without a word, the robber shot Old Joe, killing him instantly. Crockett (again reportedly) shouted “You son of a Bitch, you’ve killed the best damn lead horse there is.” Crockett threw out the box that contained about $70 and the bandit collected about $7.00 from the passengers. The bandit was never caught though he was later identified as Henry Wise, a former resident of Forest Hill who have served time in an Arizona jail for stage robbery.\n\nOn July 5th a group from Forest Hill came out to bury Old Joe. They put him in a sluice cut near the spot that he had died. About a year later Forest Hill residents placed a large slab of slate at the site to commemorate his passing. It was said that every fourth of July Forest Hill residents put a flag on Old Joe’s monument. In the 1930’s the slate slab was stolen and Ruhkala Monument Company of Rocklin donate a granite tombstone, when the Foresthill Road was widened in the 1990’s, Old Joe was moved and in 2001 the Naïve Sons of the Golden West erected a new monument with a wagon wheel atop it. Residents still frequently leave flags and flowers at Joe’s grave site\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?',

                body: '“Dear mother I am about to make my exit to another country I take this opportunity to write you a few lines. Probably you may never hear from me again. If not, I hope we may meet where parting is no prodigal career in this country. I’ve always recollected your fond admonitions, and if I had lived up to them, I would have not been in the present position; but dear mother, though my faith has been a cruel one, yet I have no one to blame but myself”, These were the words of Tom Bell prior to his death.\n\nBorn Thomas J. Hodges in Rome, Tennessee, he saw action in the Mexican–American War as a surgeon. Following the war he traveled to California during the California Gold Rush, but was unsuccessful as a prospector, later drifting around California as a gambler and as a doctor at times for several years. The outlaw "Doc Hodges" was arrested for stealing eleven mules. When he was arrested in 1855, wanting to confuse the peace officers, he gave the name Tom Bell, a small-time cattle rustler. In 1855 he was serving time in Angel Island Prison for robbery when he met Bill Gristy and successfully escaped several weeks later. He escaped with the help of his profession as a doctor by faking a severe illness that fooled the prison doctor, which allowed him to escape. With Gristy, Bell formed an outlaw gang of five men that grew to fifty with Bell planning and sending out teams robbing stages for several months from their hideout in the foothills near Auburn.\n\nOn August 12, 1856, after their spy spotted the Camptonville-Maryville stage carrying $100,000 (~$2.55 million in 2024) worth of gold bullion, the gang unsuccessfully attempted to rob it. In an exchange of gunfire, a woman passenger was killed and two male passengers were wounded before the gang was driven off by the stagecoach guards. The slain female passenger was a black woman by the name of Mrs. Tilghman, the wife of a popular barber from Maryville.\n\nThe robbery and death of the woman passenger angered citizens, and both a sheriff\'s posse and citizen vigilantes conducted a massive search for the gang. October 4, 1856, an impromptu posse commanded by Judge George Gordon Belt, a Merced River rancher, and his deputies snuck up on bell leveled their guns at him as Judge Belt Sayed “I believe you’re the man we have been looking for” “Very Probably” Bell replied. The posse decided that Bell was unworthy of due process and were to hang him Vigilante style. Prior to his hanging Judge Belt allowed Bell a drink of whiskey and to say his final words. Bell lifted the bottle to the men and stated “I have no bitterness toward anyone of you” with that Bell then read his letter to his mother aloud.\n\nJudge Belt took possession of the letter Bell wrote which was later printed in the San Francisco Alta paper. Readers reacted sympathetically to his letter to his mother, but his second letter prompted controversy. It was to his mistress a Mrs, Elizabeth Hood who harbored the outlaw on number of occasions. He proclaimed his innocence stating “I have been betrayed. I am accused of every robbery that has been committed for the past twelve months, which is entirely false. I have never committed but three robberies. I am to die like a dog.”\n\nFrom all other accounts during the spring and summer of 1856 rarely a night had passed without a resident of the Gold Country finding themselves staring down Tom Bells revolver while being relieved of their money or livestock.\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHERN?',

WELL APPARENTLY THE GRAND COUNCIL WAS NOT AMUSED AND JERKED THEIR CHARTER A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. I PERSONALLY LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS RECENT TURN OF EVENTS HASN\'T SLOWED THEM DOWN ONE BIT\n\n\n\n# PLUMAS DEL ORO CHAPTER EIGHT\n\nFROM THE SPANISH "FEATHERS OF GOLD" WHEN THEY FIRST SAW THE DUCK DOWN FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THE SPANISH EXPLORERS KNEW THAT A FINE MEAL COULD BE FOUND UPSTREAM SO THEY CALLED THAT PARTICULAR TRIBUTARY  THE FEATHER RIVER. THIS CHAPTER\'S TERRITORY IS ALL OF PLUMAS COUNTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TOWN OF RABBIT CREEK BUT THAT\'S ANOTHER STORY\n\n\n\n# BILL MEEK CHAPTER NINE\n\nWILLIAM "BULL" MEEK WAS A MULE SKINNER , TEAMSTER AND WELLS FARGO AGENT BUT HE WAS MOST KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY TO SPIN A YARN AS THEY USED TO SAY. I GUESS IT\'S SAFE TO SAY THAT TRUCK DRIVING AND BULLSHITTING  HAVE ALWAYS GONE HAND IN HAND. IF THAT WASN\'T ENOUGH HE WAS ALSO AN X-HUMBUG, SO THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT AS TO WHY HIS NICKNAME WAS "BULL"\n\nAPPARENTLY THIS CHAPTER CHANGED THEIR NAME AND THEIR NUMBER SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE AND THEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE WILLIAM STEWART CHAPTER IN 1962 THEREBY BECOMING\n\n\n\n# Wm. "BULL" MEEK -Wm. MORRIS STEWART CHAPTER TEN\n\nTHIS IS THE LARGEST CHAPTER IN THE MOTHERLODE CONTROLLING\n\nYUBA, SUTTER AND MOST OF NEVADA COUNTY AS WELL AS A TOWN IN BUTTE CO.\n\nWILLIAM MORRIS STEWART WAS THE FIRST U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA HE WAS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION AND A PRETTY FAIR BULLSHITTER HIMSELF AFTER ALL HE WAS A LAWYER\n\n\n\n# JOAQUIN MURRIETA CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nON THE THIRTEENTH OF APRIL 1850 A LAW WAS PASSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO KNOWN AS "THE GREASER ACT" IT TAXED ALL FOREIGN BORN MINERS TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH.  THIS EFFECTIVELY MEANT THE CHINESE AND THE MEXICANS. NOW THIS LAW HAD LITTLE REAL IMPACT ON THE CHINESE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THEY WERE ALREADY PAYING PROTECTION MONEY TO THE TONGS ANYWAY AND SECONDLY THEY HAD A HABIT OF WORKING CLAIMS COLLECTIVELY MEANING THEY WOULD HAVE AS MANY AS THIRTY PEOPLE WORKING ONE CLAIM SO THE FOREIGN MINERS TAX PROVED NO REAL BURDEN TO THEM.\n\nHOWEVER THE MEXICANS AND MOST PARTICULARLY THE CALIFORNIOS WERE NOT AT ALL HAPPY  WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT THEY WERE BORN IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR INABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH MADE IT DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE IT.\n\nSOMETIMES THE TAX TURNED OUT TO BE MORE THAN A PARTICULAR CLAIM WAS WORTH.\n\nNOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF SOMEONE TOOK OVER YOUR HOMELAND AND THEN TAXED YOU SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAD NOT MASTERED THEIR LANGUAGE.\n\nMANY OF THESE MEN TURNED TO A LIFE OF CRIME.\n\nALMOST OVERNIGHT THERE WERE REPORTS UP AND DOWN THE MOTHERLODE OF RUTHLESS DESPARADOS PERPETRATING MUDEROUS ATTACKS ON WHITES AND CHINESE AFTER A WHILE SOMEONE IN THE MEDIA DETERMINED THAT THESE HEINOUS ACTS MUST BE THE WORK OF A BAND OF CUT THROATS BUT WHO WAS THEIR LEADER?\n\nJUST BEFORE BEING HUNG FOR BANDITRY A MAN NAMED TEODOR VASQEZ IMPLICATED ONE JOAQUIN MURRIETA  SOMEONE HE HAD NEVER MET  . AS HE STOOD ON THE GALLOWS PLAYING FOR TIME HE MANAGED TO COME UP WITH THE NAMES OF MANY OTHERS BUT THIS ONE NAME MANAGED TO STICK IN PEOPLES MINDS MOSTLY BECAUSE HE WAS SAID TO HAVE A SCAR ON HIS FACE.\n\nTHE NEWSPAPERS HAVING LITTLE ELSE TO GO BY SEIZED ON THIS AND IT TOOK OFF FROM THERE... ENTER HARRY LOVE. HARRY WAS AN OPPORTUNIST OF THE FIRST ORDER WHO MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO BANKROLL AN OUTFIT LED BY HIM THAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA RANGERS\n\nWE HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON MR. LOVE\'S PAST EXCEPT WHAT HE HIMSELF REVEALED IN HIS OWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY THIS WAS QUITE A PIECE OF WORK IN WHICH HE CLAIMED TO BE A WAR HERO AND A TEXAS RANGER.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME JOHN BIGLER WAS EAGER TO SEE THE NEWSPAPERS PRINT SOMETHING FAVORABLE ABOUT HIS REGIME AND THE CALIFORNIA RANGERS SEEMED LIKE JUST THE TICKET.\n\nHARRY LOVE WAS GIVEN FREE REIN TO HAND PICK HIS OWN MEN AND QUICKLY SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH RUTHLESS TYPES LIKE THE MAN WHO SHOT JIM SAVAGE WALTER HARVEY. FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THE RANGERS RODE UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN PURSUIT OF THE NOTORIOUS BANDIT JOAQUIN ALTHOUGH THE RANGERS CLAIMED TO BE RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF THEIR CELEBRATED QUARRY WHENEVER THEY NEEDED FUNDING FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE. HARRY KNEW THAT HIS FORTUNE LIE IN KEEPING THE LEGEND OF JOAQUIN ALIVE FOR AS LONG AS HE COULD.\n\nEVENTUALLY ANY VIOLENT CRIME COMMITTED BY AN HISPANIC WAS CREDITED TO JOAQUIN OR ONE OF HIS BAND NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS FROM SAN DIEGO TO YREKA WOULD CREDIT THE BANDIT WITH BEING ABLE TO BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONE TIME. ONE WOULD THINK THAT THIS WOULD TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE SCRATCH THEIR HEADS AND SAY "NO WAY."\n\nBUT IT HAD JUST THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IT TENDED TO LEND A SUPERNATURAL AIR TO THE BANDIT AND HIS MEN.\n\nEVENTUALLY THE STATE GREW WEARY OF DOLING OUT ALL THIS MONEY TO HARRY AND HIS MEN AND DEMANDED RESULTS\n\nWELL RESULTS THEY WANTED AND RESULTS THEY GOT. THE CALIFORNIA RANGERS FINALLY GOT THEIR MAN OR AT LEAST SOMEONE WHO RESEMBLED HIM. THEY LOPPED OFF THE FELLOWS HEAD AND PRESENTED THEIR GRISLY TROPHY ALONG WITH THE HAND OF THREE FINGERED JACK ONE OF HIS KNOWN ACCOMPLICES. WITH NO REASON TO JUSTIFY THE FURTHER EXISTENCE OF THE RANGERS THEY WERE DISBANDED.\n\nSTRANGELY ENOUGH THE CRIME RATE AMONG MEXICANS WAS UNAFFECTED BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO NOTICE BECAUSE JOAQUIN WAS DEAD!\n\nEVER THE OPPORTUNIST HARRY LOVE TOOK HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD HE WOULD HAVE MADE P.T. BARNUM PROUD TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THE STATE SHOWING OFF THE HEAD AND HAND CAREFULLY PRESERVED IN A JAR OF ALCOHOL YES THE ENTERTAINMENT STARVED PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PAID GOOD MONEY TO SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT AND HARRY AND HIS ENTOURAGE CONTINUED TO LINE THEIR POCKETS HAWKING THE LEGEND OF JOAQUIN. AFTER A WHILE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE HAD SEEN THE HEAD AND HARRY HAD TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE SOME BEER MONEY SO HE  APPEALED TO AND GOT FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE MONEY TO COVER ALL OF HIS "EXPENSES" THAT HE HAD INCURRED AS THE STATES TIRELESS SERVANT.\n\nSADLY THE HEAD OF JOAQUIN WAS LOST IN THE GREAT SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE.\n\n\n\n# JAMES MARSHALL CHAPTER FORTY NINE\n\nJAMES WILSON MARSHALL WAS A DESCENDANT OF JOHN HART A SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.  HE WAS ALSO RELATED TO JOHN MARSHALL THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.  HE HAILED FROM A TOWN CALLED LAMBERTVILLE N.J. WHERE HE IS STILL CONSIDERED THEIR FAVORITE SON. YOUNG WILSON WAS A WHEELWRIGHT.  BACK IN THOSE DAYS A GOOD CARPENTER DREAMED OF SOMEDAY BEING GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE WHEELS. AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF RAMBLING WHICH INCLUDED MISSOURI, OREGON HE EVENTUALLY CAME TO SUTTER\'S FORT WHERE HE COULD MAKE OR FIX ANYTHING FROM SPINNING WHEELS TO FURNITURE.\n\nAFTER TAKING A ROLE IN THE BEAR FLAG REBELLION MR. MARSHALL RETURNED TO THE RANCH HE HAD ESTABLISHED WITH THE WAGES HE HAD MADE WORKING FOR CAPTAIN SUTTER ONLY TO FIND IT HAD BEEN PILLAGED IN HIS ABSENCE.  HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO BACK TO WORK FOR THE GOOD CAPTAIN.\n\nAT A PLACE NOT FAR FROM HERE CALLED COLOMA MR. MARSHALL\'S JOB WAS TO CONSTRUCT A SAWMILL TO FURNISH BUILDING MATERIALS FOR SUTTERS GROWING EMPIRE. THE SAWMILL WAS TO BE RUN BY HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE AMERICAN RIVER USING A WATER DRIVEN WHEEL. AFTER A RATHER DISMAL TRIAL RUN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MORE WATER WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE TAILRACE TO GET THE WHEEL TO TURN FAST ENOUGH TO BE ABLE  TO MILL ANY LUMBER. THE SOLUTION WAS TO DIG IN THE DAYTIME AND LET THE WATER RUN THROUGH AT NIGHT.  NOW JAMES HAD A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF GEOLOGY AND HAD REMARKED IN HIS WRITINGS OF "BLOSSOM" (QUARTZ OUTCROPPINGS) IN THE AREA WELL BEFORE THE ACTUAL GOLD DISCOVERY DATE.  WHEN THE WATER SCOURED OUT THE TAILRACE, NATURALLY THE GOLD WOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE FISSURES IN THE BEDROCK.  THAT MONDAY MARSHALL ORDERED THE HEAD GATE AT THE UPPER END OF THE DITCH SEALED OFF WITH LEAVES, DIRT AND SAW DUST, THUS ALLOWING NO WATER TO COME THROUGH.  WALKING THROUGH THE DITCH HE SPOTTED SOME "COLOR".  NOT WANTING TO BE EMBARRASSED, HE TESTED WHAT HE FOUND BY HITTING IT WITH A ROCK.  IT DID NOT SHATTER, AS FOOLS GOLD WOULD, AND THIS CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS. HE WRAPPED HIS FINDINGS IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND TOOK THEM TO CAPTAIN SUTTER.\n\nTHIS WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD NEWS EXCEPT THAT JOHN SUTTER HAD NO CLAIM TO THE LAND THAT THE SAW MILL WAS SITTING ON.  THE FACT IS, THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD PROVED TO BE A DISASTER FOR JOHANN AUGUSTUS SUTTER.  BECAUSE ALL OF HIS WORKERS AT THE FORT LEFT THEIR JOBS FOR THE GOLD FIELDS.  EVEN MARSHALL HIMSELF CAUGHT GOLD FEVER AND GAVE UP ON THE MILL AFTER ONLY TWO YEARS OF OPERATION.\n\nJAMES HAD NUMEROUS OTHER BUSINESS  VENTURES RANGING FROM FARMING AN APPLE ORCHARD TO WINE MAKING TO SELLING HIS AUTOGRAPH FOR .25 A COPY.  ON AUGUST 10, 1885 JAMES WILSON MARSHALL DIED.  A MONUMENT WAS BUILT OVER HIS GRAVE IN COLOMA THAT PORTRAYS MARSHALL WITH A GOLD NUGGET IN ONE HAND AND POINTING TO THE GOLD DISCOVERY SITE WITH THE OTHER.\n\n\n\n# TRINITARIANUS CHAPTER SIXTY TWO\n\nTHE CHAPTER FROM TRINITY COUNTY IS SOMETIMES PRONOUNCED\n\nTRIH-NIH-TEAR-REE-AAH-NUHS BUT XNGH "REDEYE" WHO WAS TAKEN IN BY CHAPTER SIXTY TWO BACK BEFORE I WAS EVEN ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP SAYS, "AY-NUS".\n\nREGARDLESS OF IT\'S PRONUNCIATION NO ONE FROM THERE I\'VE TALKED TO KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK IT MEANS\n\n\n\n# HUMBUG CHAPTER SEVENTY THREE\n\nTHE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY DEFINES HUMBUG ALTERNATIVELY AS A HOAX OR A PERSON WHO DELIBERATLY SETS OUT TO DECIEVE OTHERS, A CHARLATAN.  I AM SURE EVERYONE HERE IS WELL AWARE OF A THIRD DEFINITION OF THE WORD HUMBUG, THAT  OF COURSE BEING AN X-HUMBUG IN IT\'S LARVAL STAGE\n\nTHERE IS A CREEK IN SISKIYOU COUNTY CALLED THE HUMBUG, WHICH FLOWS THROUGH THEIR TERRITORY AND INTO THE MIGHTY KLAMATH. I CAN\'T SAY FOR SURE BUT IT\'S POSSIBLE THAT THEIR ONCE WAS A TOWN OF THE SAME NAME BUT IT\'S NOT ON THE MAP NOW. IF ANYONE HAS ANYMORE INFORMATION ON THE HUMBUG CHAPTER I\'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.\n\n\n\n# GROWLERSBURG CHAPTER EIGHTY SIX\n\nGROWLERSBURG WAS THE ORIGINAL NAME OF GEORGETOWN WHICH ALONG WITH UNCLE TOM\'S CABIN MAKES UP THE GROWLERSBURG ENVIRONS\n\n\n\n#AL PACKER  ONE HUNDRED\n\nTHIS IS AN OUTPOST OF THE MATT WARNER CHAPTER AND CLAIMS THE ENTIRE STATE OF COLORADO AS THEIR TERRITORY.\n\nAFTER THE WORST SNOWSTORM IN MANY MANY YEARS AL PACKER AND SOME OTHERS FOUND THEMSELVES SNOWED IN FOR THE WINTER.THIS WAS  NOT FAR FROM WHAT WAS AT THAT TIME THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE UNITED STATES AT AROUND 14,000 FEET.  AFTER A FEW MONTHS, STARVATION DROVE THESE MEN TO DESPERATION AND THE LIVING BEGAN TO FEED OFF THE BODIES OF THE DEAD. ONCE A MAN HAS CROSSED THAT LINE AND HE BECOMES A CANNIBAL , MURDER BECOMES JUST ANOTHER CRIME. OBVIOUSLY\n\nIT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE SURVIVORS BEGAN TO CONTEMPLATE EACH OTHER. AL PACKER AND HIS PARTNER DID AWAY WITH THE OTHERS AND FED OFF THEIR BODIES\n\nEVENTUALLY MR. PACKER KILLED HIS PARTNER BECAUSE HE WAS SURE THAT HE WAS PLOTTING HIS DEMISE. WHEN THE THAW FINALLY CAME, AL PACKER WAS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE\n\nAL PACKER IS THE ONLY MAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES TO BE TRIED AND HUNG FOR THE CRIME OF MURDER FOR THE PUPOSE OF CANNIBALISM\n\n\n\n# EUREKA CHAPTER 101\n\nEUREKA IS A GREEK WORD MEANING "I HAVE FOUND IT" WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE MOTTO. WHICH USUALLY IS IN REFERENCE TO GOLD\n\nTHIS PARTICULAR CHAPTER IS BASED IN EUREKA AND THEIR TERRITORY ENCOMPASSES HUMBOLDT COUNTY.  THEY\'VE TAKEN THE NUMBER DESIGNATION 101 FROM THE HIWAY THAT PASSES THROUGH TOWN\n\n\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHREN!\n\nFYIK',

GONE TO THE GOLDEN HILLS\n\nAND "SCOTMAN" WHOSE LUCK FINALLY RAN OUT WHEN A JUDGE SAID, "STRIKE THREE"\n\n\n\nI WOULD LIKE TO THANK "SOURDOUGH SCOTT" FOR GIVING ME THIS BOOK AS IT PROVED INVALUABLE IN THE WRITING OF THIS REPORT THAT I CALL...\n\n# THE IMPACT\n\n\nSOME MIGHT THINK THAT THE  RUSH OF \'49 WAS AN INCIDENT THAT HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY LET ALONE THE WORLD . NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH\n\nTHE LURE OF CALIFORNIA\'S GOLD BROUGHT THOUSANDS OF "RUSHERS" FROM ALL POINTS OF THE GLOBE. THESE PEOPLE WERE THE CREAM OF CIVILIZATION, POOR BUT INDUSTRIOUS. DOWN ON THEIR LUCK, BUT NOT IN SPIRIT. WHY ELSE WOULD A PERSON BRAVE THE UNCERTAINTIES OF NINETEENTH CENTURY TRAVEL;  IT WAS BETTER TO DIE FREE THAN TO ROT IN DEBTORS PRISON. IT WAS BETTER TO GAMBLE IT ALL ON AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THAN TO REMAIN AT HOME AND FACE CERTAIN STARVATION.\n\nTHE MERE CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO RISE ABOVE ONES LOW STATION IN LIFE WAS WORTH ANY RISK.  THE CAUSES WERE MANY BUT THE REASONS WERE ALL THE SAME;\n\nTHE POTATO FAMINE IN IRELAND KILLED UNTOLD THOUSANDS DURING WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE "THE BLACK FORTIES"\n\nIN FRANCE  NAPOLEON\'S ILL-FATED ATTEMPTS TO BECOME EMPEROR OF EUROPE HAD BANKRUPTED A POPULACE FORCED TO PAY "REPARATIONS" TO THE BANK OF ENGLAND\n\nOUR OWN COUNTRY WAS IN THE MIDST OF A SEVERE ECONOMIC DEPRESSION. THIS DEPRESSION WAS PERPETRATED BY WHAT WE NOW CALL THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN THE 1830\'S IT  WAS  KNOWN AS THE NATIONAL BANK. BY TIGHTENING UP THE MONEY MARKET THEY WERE ABLE TO HOLD THE NATIONS ECONOMY HOSTAGE IN RETALIATION FOR PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON\'S REVOKING THEIR CHARTER AS THE NATIONAL TREASURY ON JULY 10, 1832.\n\nSETTLERS HAD ALREADY BEEN ARRIVING FROM THE "STATES", EAGER TO TILL THE  TAX FREE SOIL TO BE FOUND IN OREGON AND THE NORTHERNMOST REGION OF MEXICO KNOWN AS ALTA (OR UPPER) CALIFORNIA.\n\nWHEN "THE SHOUT WENT UP",   THIS TRICKLE BECAME A FLOOD. THEIR NUMBERS BOLSTERED BY THE OPPORTUNISTS SEEKING TO GET RICH QUICK, THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA WAS QUICKLY AMERICANIZED.\n\nTHE  MENTION OF THE WORD "FORTY-NINERS" TODAY BRINGS TO MIND A  FOOTBALL TEAM... IN THE ENSUING MELEE THAT WAS THE GOLD RUSH, TO BE LABELED A\n\n" FORTY NINER" WAS AN INSULT. IT MEANT AN OPPORTUNIST OF THE WORST SORT USUALLY  A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE OR A DESERTER FROM THE ARMY. YEARS LATER  IT WOULD BECOME A BADGE OF HONOR, THE DESIGNATION OF A MAN OF EXPERIENCE, OF WISDOM ACQUIRED THROUGH HARDSHIP,  HARD WORK AND BETTER THAN AVERAGE LUCK. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE WORD FORTYNINER CAME TO BE SYNONYMOUS WITH SURVIVOR. MOST OF THE ORIGINAL FORTY NINERS HAD EITHER WENT HOME PENNILESS OR DIED FROM CHOLERA, PNEUMONIA, TYPHUS OR MALNUTRITION THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A "RUSHER" WAS QUITE SHORT INDEED. BAD FOOD BAD WEATHER BAD LUCK AND BAD PRICES FOR EVERYTHING. EVEN IF YOU DID STRIKE IT RICH YOU BECAME THE TARGET OF CLAIM JUMPERS AND BANDITS.\n\nFROM THE YEAR 1848 TO 1900 THE BILLIONS IN GOLD THAT WAS MINED FROM THE MOTHERLODE ROCKETED THE UNITED STATES TO THE STATUS OF WORLD POWER. WE WERE BEHOLDEN TO NONE. WITHOUT THIS STATE\'S  MINERAL WEALTH THIS COUNTRY WOULDN\'T BE IN ANY BETTER SHAPE THAN MEXICO IS IN TODAY.\n\nBEFORE THE RUSH THIS COUNTRY WAS A MONETARY FLEDGLING, STRUGGLING  WITH THE INTERNATIONAL BANKING EMPIRES. AFTER THE RUSH THE PRICE OF PRECIOUS METALS ON THE WORLD MARKET WAS SET BY US AND THAT WAS SPELLED U. S.\n\nONCE THE RUSH HAD PLAYED OUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TURNED TO AGRICULTURE\n\nTHE VAST FLOOD PLAIN THAT WAS THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEYS BECAME WHAT THEY ARE TODAY...

                body: "WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS STILL CALLED THE AMERICAN COLONIES THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CALLED FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM GREAT BRITAIN. AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER THERE WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL LOYAL TO THE CROWN THESE PEOPLE WERE CALLED APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH, LOYALISTS.\n\nTHERE WAS A THIRD GROUP OF CITIZENS WHO WERE JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT ALL TOGETHER THROUGH COMPROMISE\n\nIT IS BECAUSE OF THIS THIRD GROUP OF COLONIALS THAT THE FIRST \"AMERICAN\" FLAG WAS CREATED.\n\nUP UNTIL THAT TIME EACH COLONY HAD IT'S OWN MILITIA THAT FOUGHT UNDER THE BRITISH \"UNION JACK\". THE CONTINENTAL FLAG WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY IT FEATURED THE UNION JACK IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF A FIELD OF RED AND WHITE STRIPES\n\nTHIS WAS SIMILAR TO A BRITISH NAVAL ENSIGN WHICH HAD THE UNION JACK IMPOSED ON A WHITE FIELD.\n\nTHE REASON FOR SUCH A CONFIGURATION WAS A VERY PRACTICAL ONE.\n\nWHEN TRYING TO CONVEY A DISTRESS SIGNAL AT SEA IT'S CUSTOMARY TO INVERT THE SHIP'S FLAG.\n\nBY FLYING YOUR COLORS UPSIDE DOWN YOU CAN SUMMON OTHER SHIPS TO YOUR AID.\n\nTHE UNION JACK ITSELF APPEARS THE SAME WHEN INVERTED, FOR THAT REASON IT MAKES A LOUSY NAVAL ENSIGN.\n\nTHE REASON FOR THE PLACEMENT IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER IS EVEN MORE PRACTICAL WHEN HIGH WINDS TATTER THE FLAG THE IMPORTANT PART WILL STILL BE INTACT.\n\n\n\nWHEN THE HOSTILITIES ENSUED BETWEEN THE BRITISH REDCOATS AND THE CONTINENTAL ARMY IT WAS NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE UNION JACK IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER TO SOMETHING ELSE.\n\nTHE BLUE BACKGROUND WAS KEPT BUT THE VARIOUS CROSSES OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WERE REPLACED BY THIRTEEN STARS ARRANGED IN AN ARC OVER THE NUMBER \"76\". IT WAS TO BE A CONSTELLATION OF STARS ARRANGED AROUND THE YEAR WHICH UNIFIED THEM\n\nTHIS HAS COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE BENINGTON FLAG.\n\n(CONTRARY TO THE POPULAR MYTH BETSY ROSS DID NOT DESIGN THIS OR ANY OTHER FLAG.)\n\nTHIS WAS THE FIRST VERSION OF WHAT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS \"THE STARS AND STRIPES.\" ALTHOUGH SOME MILITIAS WERE STILL USING THE PREVIOUS CONTINENTAL FLAG AND OTHERS WERE USING VARIATIONS OF THE \"DONT TREAD ON ME\" SERPENT,\n\nIN TIME ALL WOULD FIGHT UNDER THE VENERABLE STARS AND STRIPES.\n\nTHE FOUNDING FATHERS ALSO GAVE US A CODE OF ETIQUETTE\n\nTHE REASON THAT IT IS FOLDED INTO A COMPACT TRIANGLE WITH NO RED OR WHITE VISIBLE WAS TO ENABLE THE BEARER TO MAKE IT APPEAR TO THE BRITISH SOLDIERS AS THOUGH SAID BEARER WAS ACTUALLY CARRYING A TRICORNERED HAT WHICH WERE QUITE POPULAR AT THE TIME.\n\nIF YOU WERE CAUGHT WITH THE STARS AND STRIPES IN YOUR POSSESSION YOU WOULD BE HANGED FOR TREASON .\n\nTHE REASON THAT WE STILL OBSERVE THIS TRADITION IS VERY LOGICAL AS WELL.\n\nIT MUST BE EASILY IDENTIFIED WHEN IT IS FOUND IN IT'S STORED CONDITION THEREFORE IT MUST ALWAYS BE FOLDED IN ACCORDANCE\n\nWITH TRADITION.\n\nWHENEVER A FLAG IS FOUND TO BE UNSERVICEABLE IT SHOULD BE TURNED OVER TO THE AMERICAN LEGION FOR CEREMONIAL DESTRUCTION. IT SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR ANY OTHER THAN IT'S INTENDED PURPOSE\n\nNEVER FLY THE STARS AND STRIPES AND THE FLAG OF ANOTHER COUNTRY ON THE SAME POLE THIS SYMBOLIZES A MILITARY VICTORY AND IS A GRAVE INSULT TO THE UNDERLYING FLAG.\n\nA PROPER DISPLAY OF THIS TYPE WOULD PROVIDE FLAGS OF EQUAL SIZE ON STAFFS OF EQUAL HEIGHT\n\nWHEN CALIFORNIA BECAME THE THIRTY SEVENTH STATE IT CREATED A PROBLEM. YOU SEE UP UNTIL THEN PRIME NUMBERS HAD BEEN AVOIDED THE NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN IS ONLY DIVISIBLE BY ITSELF AND THE NUMBER ONE. THIS MADE FOR AN UNLIKELY PATTERN OF STARS, BUT BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S IMPORTANCE IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT IT BE ADDED TO THE FLAG AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\n\nTHUS THE CALIFORNIA ADMISSION FLAG HAS THE ODDEST PATTERN OF STARS OF ANY OF THE VERSIONS\n\nTHE NATIONAL ANTHEMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES TYPICALLY EXTOL THE VIRTUES OF A GREAT LAND, A GREAT MONARCH OR A GREAT REVOLUTION.\n\nOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS ABOUT THAT WHICH CAN NEVER BE POLLUTED, CORRUPTED OR DENIGRATED\n\nOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS NOT ABOUT WAR\n\nOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS ABOUT A RECTANGULAR PIECE OF FABRIC THAT WEARS LIKE IRON\n\nOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS CALLED THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER AND ITS ABOUT\n\nA FLAG CALLED THE STARS AND STRIPES\n\n\n\n<FYIK/>\n\n\n\n\n## Sharpstone\n\n\n\n\n\nI WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT BROTHER SHARPSTONE\n\nI DIDN'T SAY ANY THING AT HIS MEMORIAL SERVICE AND\n\nI'VE BEEN KICKING MYSELF IN THE ASS EVER SINCE\n\n\n\nNOT TOO MANY BROTHERS COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO THIS GUY\n\nHE DIDN'T REALLY FIT THE CLAMPER STEREOTYPE\n\nHE WASN'T LOUD OR BRASH\n\nHE WAS ALWAYS READY TO HELP OUT AND NEVER WANTED ANYTHING IN RETURN\n\n\n\nIN THE ENTIRE TIME I KNEW HIM I DON'T THINK I EVER HEARD HIM COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING\n\nHE WAS ONE OF THOSE RARE BROTHERS WHO ALWAYS CHOSE HIS WORDS\n\nAND ALWAYS HELD HIS LIQUOR WELL\n\nTO PUT IT SIMPLY HE DIDN'T REALLY STAND OUT IN THE CROWD\n\nTOMMY STOOD OUT IN A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY\n\n\n\nTOMMY WAS A REDSHIRT'S REDSHIRT\n\nIF I EVER NEEDED OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT\n\nHE WAS DEFINITELY ON THE SHORT LIST OF BROTHERS THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO CALL\n\n\n\nWHEN I LAST TALKED TO HIM TOMMY KNEW THAT HIS NUMBER WAS UP\n\nI DON'T KNOW IF I COULD HANDLE THAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE\n\n\n\nTHE WORLD IS A LITTLE COLDER NOW THAT HE'S GONE\n\nAND I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT HE WILL BE MISSED BY EVERYONE\n\nEVEN THOSE WHO DIDN'T KNOW HIM\n\nWHAT SAY THE BRETHREN!\n\nFYIK",
